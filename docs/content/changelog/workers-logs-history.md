## Enable Worker Logs

Worker logs are enabled by default in the latest version of NuxtHub core module (`@nuxthub/core >= v0.8.27`).


::note
If you are using older versions and you cannot upgrade, you can enable Worker Logs by setting `hub.bindings.observability.logs` to `true` in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  hub: {
    bindings: {
      observability: {
        logs: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```
