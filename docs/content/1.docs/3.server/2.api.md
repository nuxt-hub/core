## Getting Started

NuxtHub uses Nitro's OpenAPI generation to access your Nuxt project's API.

To enable the API, you need to add enable Nitro's experimental `openAPI` feature. You can do this by adding the `nitro.experimental.openAPI` property to your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    experimental: {
      openAPI: true
    }
  }
})
```

After you deploy your project, NuxtHub Admin will showcase your API documentation using [Scalar](https://scalar.com).

## Nuxt Devtools

In development, you can use Nuxt Devtools to access your API routes. using the `Server Routes` tab.

It list all the API routes in your project as well as providing a playground to send and test your endpoints.

Check out the [Nuxt Devtools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) documentation for more information.
