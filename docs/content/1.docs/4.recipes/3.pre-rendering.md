description: Pre-render pages at build time for maximum performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.

When using NuxtHub, you need to build your application with the [`nuxt build`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/build) in order to keep your server when deploying your application.

However, you can also pre-render your pages at build time to improve performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.

::tip{to="https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering"}
This is possible thanks to **Nuxt's Hybrid Rendering** to allow different caching rules per route.

## Route Rules

### Globally

You can define route rules in your `nuxt.config.ts` to specify how each route should be rendered:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/': { prerender: true }
  }
})
```

When running `nuxt build`, Nuxt will pre-render the `/` route and save the `index.html` file in the output directory.

When deploying with NuxtHub on Cloudflare Pages, it will serve the pre-rendered HTML file directly from the edge for maximum performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.

### Page Level

It is also possible to define route rules at the page level using the [`defineRouteRules`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-route-rules) util in the page component:

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
defineRouteRules({
  prerender: true
})
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</template>
```

This is equivalent of our example above in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

**Notes:**
- A rule defined in `~/pages/foo/bar.vue` will be applied to `/foo/bar` requests.
- A rule in `~/pages/foo/[id].vue` will be applied to `/foo/**` requests.

::important{to="https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/experimental-features#inlinerouterules"}
As this is an experimental feature, you need to enable it in your `nuxt.config.ts` files with `experimental: { inlineRouteRules: true }`.
::

## Dynamic Pre-rendering

In some cases, you may want to Nuxt to pre-render other pages when pre-rendering a specific page.

This is useful when pre-rendering all the blog posts when pre-rendering the blog index page. To achieve this, we can use the [`prerenderRoutes`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/prerender-routes) util in the page component:

```vue [pages/blog/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// Pre-render the /blog page
defineRouteRules({ prerender: true })

const { data: posts } = await useFetch('/api/posts')

// Tell Nuxt to pre-render all blog posts
prerenderRoutes(posts.value.map(post => `/blog/${post.slug}`))
</script>
```

It is important to tell Nuxt to pre-render the `/blog` using the `defineRouteRules`, we can also do it globally in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // If not using `defineRouteRules` in the page component
    '/blog': { prerender: true }
  }
})
```

## Caveats

If you are using authentication in your application such as [`nuxt-auth-utils`](https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-auth-utils), you need to remember that the authentication state will not be available during the pre-rendering process.

For example, if you have a header component that either display the logged in user or a login button, you need to wrap the logic inside [`<ClientOnly>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/client-only) component to avoid displaying the login button when the user is already logged in.

```vue [components/AppHeader.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { loggedIn, user } = useUserSession()

const links = [
  { label: 'Docs', to: '/docs' },
  { label: 'Blog', to: '/blog' }
]
</script>

<template>
  <UHeader title="ACME" :links="links">
    <template #right>
      <ClientOnly>
        <UButton v-if="loggedIn" to="/profile">{{ user.name }}</UButton>
        <UButton v-else to="/login">Login</UButton>
        <template #fallback>
          <!-- Display loading state -->
          <UButton :loading="true" />
        </template>
      </ClientOnly>
  </template>
</template>
```
