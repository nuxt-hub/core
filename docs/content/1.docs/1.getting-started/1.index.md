description: NuxtHub helps you build full-stack applications on the Edge.
---

NuxtHub aims to provide a complete backend experience for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) apps, allowing developers to build full-stack applications on the Edge, read more about [Nuxt on the edge](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge).

::callout
It is **currently made to be deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)** as it leverages many Cloudflare features such as KV, D1, and R2. We are looking to support other platforms in the future.
::

## Features

NuxtHub provides multiple features to help you build full-stack applications:
- **SQL database** to store your application's data with [`hubDatabase()`](/docs/storage/database)
- **Key-Value** to store JSON data accessible globally with low-latency with [`hubKV()`](/docs/storage/kv)
- **Blob storage** to store static assets, such as images, videos and more with [`hubBlob()`](/docs/storage/blob)
- **Cache storage** to cache your server route responses or functions using Nitro's [`cachedEventHandler`](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache#cached-event-handlers) and [`cachedFunction`](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache#cached-functions)

Each storage utils is auto-imported and configured to be used in your [Nuxt's server directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server).

::callout{icon="i-ph-plugs-connected-duotone" to="/docs/getting-started/deploy#remote-storage"}
NuxtHub comes with a powerful proxy system to connect to your project's resources from your local environment, allowing you to work with your remote storage as if it was local with `npx nuxi dev --remote`.
::

## Packages

We plan to provide a complete backend experience for Nuxt apps through various `@nuxthub` packages.

- [`@nuxthub/core`](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core): Main package to provide storage features
- `@nuxthub/auth`: Add authentication for user management (soon)
- `@nuxthub/email`: Send transactional emails to your users (soon)
- `@nuxthub/analytics`: Understand your traffic and track events within your application and API (soon)
- `@nuxthub/...`: You name it!

::important
We are currently in the early stages of development (beta) and are looking for feedback from the community. If you are interested in contributing, please join us on [nuxt-hub/core](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core).

The [NuxtHub admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com) is a web based dashboard to manage your NuxtHub apps. It helps you deploy your NuxtHub apps with a single command on your Cloudflare account while provisioning all the necessary resources for you. It abstracts the complexity of managing full-stack Nuxt applications on Cloudflare.

### Features

- Link your Cloudflare account and stay in control, we never mark-up Cloudflare prices
- Deploy your application with `nuxthub deploy` command
- Relax while it provisions all the necessary resources (database, kv, blob)
- Manage your app's resources with an admin panel
- Visualize application, database, and cache metrics
- Give access to team members to manage the application without sharing your Cloudflare account
- Monitor your application with logs and analytics
