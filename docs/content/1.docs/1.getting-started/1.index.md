title: What is NuxtHub?
description: NuxtHub helps you build and deploy full-stack Nuxt applications globally.
---

On top of deploying your Nuxt application, NuxtHub aims to provide a complete backend experience on top of the framework, allowing developers to build full-stack applications on the Edge, read more about [Nuxt on the Edge](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge).

It leverages Cloudflare features such as Pages, Workers Analytics, AI, KV, D1, R2 and more.

::tip
**NuxtHub is what Vercel / Netlify is for AWS, but for Cloudflare.** :br
It also deploys to your Cloudflare account so you stay in control of your data and billing as we don't mark-up Cloudflare prices.

## Features

NuxtHub provides optional features to help you build full-stack applications:
- [AI Models](/docs/features/ai) to run machine learning models, such as LLMs in Nuxt.
- [Blob storage](/docs/features/blob) to store static assets, such as images, videos and more
- [Caching system](/docs/features/cache) for your Nuxt pages, API routes or server functions
- [SQL database](/docs/features/database) to store your application's data
- [Key-Value](/docs/features/kv) to store JSON data accessible globally with low-latency
- [Open API](/docs/features/open-api) to generate your API documentation with [Scalar](https://scalar.com)

::tip{icon="i-ph-plugs-connected-duotone" to="/docs/getting-started/remote-storage"}
NuxtHub comes with a powerful proxy system to connect to your project's resources from your local environment, allowing you to work with your remote storage as if it was local with `npx nuxi dev --remote`.

The [NuxtHub admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com) is a web based dashboard to manage your NuxtHub apps. It helps you deploy your NuxtHub apps with a single command on your Cloudflare account while provisioning all the necessary resources for you.

It abstracts the complexity of managing full-stack Nuxt applications on Cloudflare:
- Link your Cloudflare account and stay in control, we never mark-up Cloudflare prices
- [Deploy your application](/docs/getting-started/deploy) with `nuxthub deploy` command or with Cloudflare Pages CI
- Relax while it provisions all the necessary resources (ai, blob, cache, database, kv)
- Manage your app's resources with an admin panel
- Visualize application, database, and cache metrics
- Give access to team members to manage the application without sharing your Cloudflare account
- Monitor your application with logs and analytics
