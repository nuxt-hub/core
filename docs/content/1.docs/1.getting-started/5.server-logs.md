Access to live stream of your server logs from the deployed server. Useful to monitor or debug your Nuxt application.

## NuxtHub Admin

When you have a successful deployment, you can access to the logs of the deployment in the [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/).  

Logs are available under the `Server > Logs` section of your project page. You can also access to the logs of each successful deployment in the `Deployments` section.


## NuxtHub CLI 

Using the NuxtHub CLI, you can access to the logs of both `production` and `preview` deployments.

### Production environment

NuxtHub will automatically detect the canonical deployment of your project and stream the logs of that deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs --production
```

### Preview environment

In preview environment, NuxtHub will stream the logs of the latest successful deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs --preview
```
