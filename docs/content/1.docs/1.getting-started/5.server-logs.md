## NuxtHub Admin

When you have a successful deployment, you can access to the logs of the deployment in the [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/).  

Logs are available under the `Server > Logs` section of your project page. You can also access to the logs of each successful deployment in the `Deployments` section.

## NuxtHub CLI 

Using the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli), you can access to the logs of both `production` and `preview` deployments.

By default, the CLI will detect based on the current branch the canonical deployment of your project and stream the logs of that deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs
```

### Production environment

To access the logs of the production environment, you can use the `--production` flag.

```bash
nuxthub logs --production
```

### Preview environment

In preview environment, NuxtHub will stream the logs of the latest successful deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs --preview
```
