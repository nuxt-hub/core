explain what cloudflare access is

nuxthub compatible and integration makes dashboard & remote storage work with access.

## Setup Cloudflare Access

setting up nuxthub on a deployed project

important: nuxt.dev domain no work with integration due to cf limitation. if nuxt.dev domain is default, on enable default becomes pages.dev.

- create service token in cf zero trust dash
  - name can be nuxthub project name
- paste the tokens into nuxthub -> settings -> general -> cloudflare access
- cf dash -> pages -> <project> -> settings -> general -> access policy -> enable
  - it'll make an access application with the preview domain by default, and add all members of the pages project via email auth
- edit access application
  - add new policy "service auth", drag it to be first, edit it then select the created service token
    - image
  - optionally add other domains to access project, like main domain or custom domains to protect them too.
    - default is just preview pages.dev domains
  - configure your access policies
    - link to cf access docs for making policies

### Importing Pages projects

- currently create access app with bypass policy for /api/_hub for everyone
- planned to support importing existing pages projects with access in the future

## Remote development

in .env set NUXT_HUB_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID and NUXT_HUB_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET to a service token added to access policy

tip: service token doesn't need to match dev/can be different/just needs to be assigned to access policy

## CLI

set env var NUXT_HUB_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID and NUXT_HUB_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
