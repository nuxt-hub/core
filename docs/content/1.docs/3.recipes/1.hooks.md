## `onHubReady()`

Use `onHubReady()` to ensure the execution of some code once NuxtHub environment bindings are set up and database migrations are applied.

::note
`onHubReady()` is a shortcut using the [`hubHooks`](#hubhooks) object under the hood that listens to the `bindings:ready` and `database:migrations:done` events.
::

```ts [server/plugins/migrations.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin(() => {
  // Only run in development
  if (import.meta.dev) {
    onHubReady(async () => {
      console.log('NuxtHub is ready! ðŸš€')
    })
  }
})

```

## `hubHooks`

The `hubHooks` object is a collection of hooks that can be used to stay synced with NuxtHub.

### Signature

```ts [Signature]
export interface HubHooks {
  'bindings:ready': () => any | void
  'database:migrations:done': () => any | void
}
```

### Usage

You can use the `hubHooks` object to listen to `HubHooks` events in your server plugins:

```ts [server/plugins/hub.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin(() => {
  hubHooks.hook('bindings:ready', () => {
    console.log('NuxtHub bindings are ready!')
    const db = hubDatabase()
  })
  // Only run in development and if the database is enabled
  if (import.meta.dev) {
    hubHooks.hook('database:migrations:done', () => {
      console.log('Database migrations are done!')
    })
  }
})
```

::note
Note that `hubHooks` is a [hookable](https://hookable.unjs.io) instance.
