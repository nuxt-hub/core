Now that you have your database schema and migrations set up, you can start querying your database.

## Importing the database

NuxtHub provides two ways to import the database client:

### Recommended: `@nuxthub/db`

Use `@nuxthub/db` to import the database client. This works everywhere, including in Nuxt server routes and external bundlers like [Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev):

```ts
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'
```

::tip{icon="i-lucide-sparkles"}
This is the **recommended approach** as it works with both Nuxt and external tools that bundle your code independently.
::

### Legacy: `hub:db`

The virtual module `hub:db` is still supported for backwards compatibility (Nuxt only):

```ts
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'
```

::tip
`db` and `schema` are auto-imported on the server-side, so you can use them directly without importing.
::

## SQL Select

```ts [server/api/users.get.ts]
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  return await db.query.users.findMany()
  // or
  return await db.select().from(schema.users)
})
```

## SQL Insert

```ts [server/api/users.post.ts]
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { name, email } = await readBody(event)

  return await db
    .insert(schema.users)
    .values({
      name,
      email,
      createdAt: new Date()
    })
    .returning()
})
```

## SQL Update

```ts [server/api/users/[id\\].patch.ts]
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { id } = getRouterParams(event)
  const { name } = await readBody(event)

  return await db
    .update(schema.users)
    .set({ name })
    .where(eq(tables.users.id, Number(id)))
    .returning()
})
```

## SQL Delete

```ts [server/api/users/[id\\].delete.ts]
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { id } = getRouterParams(event)

  const deletedUser = await db
    .delete(schema.users)
    .where(eq(schema.users.id, Number(id)))
    .returning()

  if (!deletedUser) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 404,
      message: 'User not found'
    })
  }

  return { deleted: true }
})
```

## Using with external bundlers

The `@nuxthub/db` import works seamlessly with external tools that bundle your code independently, such as [Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev).

### Example with Workflow

[Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev) is a library for building and running durable, reliable, and scalable background jobs in TypeScript. Here's how to use NuxtHub Database with Workflow:

```ts [workflow/tasks/cleanup-inactive-users.ts]
import { db, schema } from '@nuxthub/db'
import { lt } from 'drizzle-orm'

export default async function cleanupInactiveUsers() {
  // Delete users who haven't logged in for 90 days
  const ninetyDaysAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)

  const deleted = await db
    .delete(schema.users)
    .where(lt(schema.users.lastLoginAt, ninetyDaysAgo))
    .returning()

  return {
    deletedCount: deleted.length,
    deletedUserIds: deleted.map(u => u.id)
  }
}
```

### How it works

When you build your Nuxt application:

1. NuxtHub generates the database client at `node_modules/@nuxthub/db/`
2. This physical module contains your compiled database schema and client
3. External bundlers like Workflow can import and bundle this module directly
4. The `hub:db` virtual module remains available for Nuxt server routes (backwards compatibility)

::tip{icon="i-lucide-info"}
The `@nuxthub/db` package is auto-generated during development and build. You don't need to add it to your `package.json`.
::

### Benefits

- **Universal compatibility**: Works with Nuxt server routes, Workflow tasks, and any other TypeScript code
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types
- **No configuration**: Automatically synced when you run `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`
- **Single source of truth**: Your `server/db/schema.ts` files are the only place you define your schema
