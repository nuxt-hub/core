title: Pre-rendering
description: Pre-render pages at build time for maximum performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.
---

When using NuxtHub, you need to build your application with the [`nuxt build`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/build) in order to keep your server when deploying your application.

However, you can also pre-render your pages at build time to improve performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.

::tip{to="https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering"}
This is possible thanks to **Nuxt's Hybrid Rendering** to allow different caching rules per route.

## Route Rules

### Globally

You can define route rules in your `nuxt.config.ts` to specify how each route should be rendered:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/': { prerender: true }
  }
})
```

When running `nuxt build`, Nuxt will pre-render the `/` route and save the `index.html` file in the output directory.

When deploying with NuxtHub on Cloudflare Pages, it will serve the pre-rendered HTML file directly from the edge for maximum performance and avoid CPU usage on the server.
::

### Page Level

It is also possible to define route rules at the page level using the [`defineRouteRules`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-route-rules) util in the page component:

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
defineRouteRules({
  prerender: true
})
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</template>
```

This is equivalent of our example above in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

**Notes:**

- A rule defined in `~/pages/foo/bar.vue` will be applied to `/foo/bar` requests.
- A rule in `~/pages/foo/[id].vue` will be applied to `/foo/**` requests.

As this is an experimental feature, you need to enable it in your `nuxt.config.ts` files with `experimental: { inlineRouteRules: true }`.

## Dynamic Pre-rendering

In some cases, you may want to Nuxt to pre-render other pages when pre-rendering a specific page.

This is useful when pre-rendering all the blog posts when pre-rendering the blog index page. To achieve this, we can use the [`prerenderRoutes`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/prerender-routes) util in the page component:

```vue [pages/blog/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// Pre-render the /blog page
defineRouteRules({ prerender: true })

const { data: posts } = await useFetch('/api/posts')

// Tell Nuxt to pre-render all blog posts
prerenderRoutes(posts.value.map(post => `/blog/${post.slug}`))
</script>
```

It is important to tell Nuxt to pre-render the `/blog` using the `defineRouteRules`, we can also do it globally in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // If not using `defineRouteRules` in the page component
    '/blog': { prerender: true }
  }
})
```

### Using a Nuxt Module

You can also use a [local Nuxt module](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/modules) to pre-render dynamic pages, which is particularly useful if you don't have a single root page (such as `/blog`) but still need to pre-render specific routes, such as `/page-1`, `/parent/page-2`, and so on.

```ts [modules/prerender-routes.ts]
import { defineNuxtModule, addPrerenderRoutes } from '@nuxt/kit'

export default defineNuxtModule({
  meta: {
    name: 'nuxt-prerender-routes',
  },
  async setup() {
    const pages = await getDynamicPages()
    addPrerenderRoutes(pages)
  },
})

async function getDynamicPages(): string[] {
  // Replace this function with the logic for retrieving the slugs for your pages.
  return ['/page-1', '/parent/page-2']
}
```

## Pre-render All Pages

To have the same behavior as [`nuxt generate`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/generate) while keeping the server part, you can pre-render all pages by configuring the `nitro.prerender` option in the `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      // Pre-render the homepage
      routes: ['/'],
      // Then crawl all the links on the page
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
})
```

When running `nuxt build`, Nuxt will pre-render all pages and save the `index.html` file in the `dist/` directory.

### Cloudflare 100 routes limit

NuxtHub will generate a [`dist/_routes.json`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/#create-a-_routesjson-file) for Cloudflare Pages, but it has a limit of 100 excluded routes (used for static assets).

As each pre-rendered page will be added to the exclude list, we recommend to add your known pre-rendered pattern in the `nitro.cloudflare.pages.routes.exclude` option:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nitro: {
    cloudflare: {
      pages: {
        routes: {
          exclude: [
            // we know that all docs and blog pages are pre-rendered
            '/docs/*',
            '/blog/*'
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Caveats

If you are using authentication in your application such as [`nuxt-auth-utils`](https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-auth-utils), you need to remember that the authentication state will not be available during the pre-rendering process.

For example, if you have a header component that either display the logged in user or a login button, you need to wrap the logic inside the [`<AuthState>`](https://github.com/atinux/nuxt-auth-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#authstate-component) component to display a placeholder while the page is being pre-rendered.

```vue [components/AppHeader.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { loggedIn, user } = useUserSession()

const links = [
  { label: 'Docs', to: '/docs' },
  { label: 'Blog', to: '/blog' }
]
</script>

<template>
  <UHeader title="ACME" :links="links">
    <template #right>
      <AuthState>
        <UButton v-if="loggedIn" to="/profile">{{ user.name }}</UButton>
        <UButton v-else to="/login">Login</UButton>
        <template #placeholder>
          <!-- Display loading state -->
          <UButton :loading="true" />
        </template>
      </AuthState>
  </template>
</template>
```
