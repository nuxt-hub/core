## NuxtHub Admin

When you have a successful deployment, you can access to the logs of the deployment in the [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/).

Logs are available under the `Server > Logs` section of your project page. You can also access to the logs of each successful deployment in the `Deployments` section.

## NuxtHub CLI

Using the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli), you can access to the logs of both `production` and `preview` deployments.

By default, the CLI will detect based on the current branch the canonical deployment of your project and stream the logs of that deployment in the CLI.

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub logs
```

### Production environment

To access the logs of the production environment, you can use the `--production` flag.

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub logs --production
```

### Preview environment

In preview environment, NuxtHub will stream the logs of the latest successful deployment in the CLI.

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub logs --preview
```

## Cloudflare Dashboard

Worker project types can enable Worker Logs and view the Workers Observability tab dashboard in Cloudflare. Learn more on the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/).

### Enable Worker Logs

Enable Worker Logs within `hub.bindings.observability.logs` in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

::field-group
  ::field{name="observability" type="string"}
    Observability settings
    >
    > ::field{name="logs" type="boolean | object"}
    >   Enable Worker Logs with default configuration.<br><br>
    >
    >   Defaults to `head_sampling_rate: 1` and `invocation_logs: true`
    > ::
    >
    > ::field{name="logs" type="boolean | object"}

    >       Head-based sampling allows you to log a percentage of incoming requests to your Nuxt app. Especially for high-traffic
    >       applications, this helps reduce log volume and manage costs, while still providing meaningful insights into your application's
    >       performance. When you configure a head-based sampling rate, you can control the percentage of requests that get logged.
    >       All logs within the context  of the request are collected.<br><br>
    >
    >       To enable head-based sampling, set `head_sampling_rate` within the observability configuration.
    >       The valid range is from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates zero out of one hundred requests are logged, and 1 indicates
    >       every request is logged. If `head_sampling_rate` is unspecified, it is configured to a default value of 1 (100%).
    >        In the example below, `head_sampling_rate` is set to 0.01, which > means one out of every one hundred requests is logged.
    >     ::
    >
    >     ::field{name="invocation_logs" type="boolean?"}
    >       Each Workers invocation returns a single invocation log that contains details such as the Request, Response, and related metadata. These invocation logs can be identified by the field $cloudflare.$metadata.type = "cf-worker-event". Each invocation log is enriched with information available to Cloudflare in the context of the invocation.<br><br>
    >
    >       In the Workers Logs UI, logs are presented with a localized timestamp and a message. The message is dependent on the invocation handler. For example, Fetch requests will have a message describing the request method and the request URL, while cron events will be listed as cron. Below is a list of invocation handlers along with their invocation message.
