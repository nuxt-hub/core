description: How to deploy your full-stack Nuxt project to your Cloudflare account.
---

::note
To deploy your Nuxt application on the Edge, we use Cloudflare Pages. Therefore, we require you to create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account. :br **You can deploy NuxtHub projects with a free Cloudflare account.**
::

## NuxtHub Console (alpha)

The [NuxtHub Console](https://console.hub.nuxt.com) is made to simplify your experience with NuxtHub, enabling you to effortlessly manage teams and projects, as well as deploying NuxtHub application with zero-configuration on your Cloudflare account.

### Quickstart

1. Login to https://console.hub.nuxt.com
2. Connect your Cloudflare account by clicking on `Create a new token with required permissions` and follow the instructions
3. You are now ready to deploy your Nuxt project to your Cloudflare account!

### NuxtHub CLI

You can deploy your local project with a single command:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub deploy
```

The command will:
1. Ensure you are logged in on console.hub.nuxt.com
2. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project or help you create a new one
3. Build your Nuxt project with the correct preset
4. Deploy it to your Cloudflare account with all the necessary resources
4. Provide you with a URL to access your project

::note
You can also install the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli) globally with: `npm i -g nuxthub`.
::

### Cloudflare Pages CI

It is possible to use [Cloudflare Pages CI](https://pages.cloudflare.com) to deploy your project by connecting your GitHub or GitLab account. Once your repository is connected, each commit will trigger a new deployment.

1. [Create a new Cloudflare Pages project](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages/new/provider/github) and link your GitHub or Gitlab repository
2. Select the Nuxt Framework preset in the build settings and click on `Save and Deploy`
3. Open the [NuxtHub Console](https://console.hub.nuxt.com)
4. Click on `New Project` then `Import a Cloudflare Pages project`
6. Select your Cloudflare Pages project
7. Click on `Create`

::tip
That's it! NuxtHub will automatically configure the necessary resources and environment variables for you and retry the latest deployment to apply the changes!
::

## Self-hosted

You can deploy your project on your own Cloudflare account without using the NuxtHub Console.

For that, you need to create the necessary resources in your Cloudflare account and configure your project to use them:

- One [D1 database](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/d1)
- Two [KV namespaces](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces) (one for `hubKV()` and one for [server caching](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache))
- One [R2 bucket](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/new)

Then, create a [Cloudflare Pages project](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages/new/provider/github) and link your GitHub or Gitlab repository and choose the Nuxt Framework preset in the build settings.

Once your project is created, open the `Settings -> Functions` tab and set:
- Placement: Smart
- KV namespace bindings
  - `KV` -> select your KV namespace created
  - `CACHE` -> select your KV namespace for caching created
- R2 bucket bindings
  - `BLOB` -> select your R2 bucket created
- D1 database bindings
  - `DB` -> select your D1 database created

Go back to the `Deployment` tab and retry the last deployment by clicing on `...` then `Retry deployment`.

::tip
Once the deployment is done, you should be able to use `npx nuxt dev --remote` after [configuring the remote storage](/docs/getting-started/remote-storage#self-hosted)
