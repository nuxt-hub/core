::note
To deploy your Nuxt application on the Edge, we use Cloudflare Pages. Therefore, we require you to create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account. **You can deploy NuxtHub projects with a free Cloudflare account.**
::

The [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com) is made to simplify your experience with NuxtHub, enabling you to effortlessly manage teams and projects, as well as deploying NuxtHub application with zero-configuration on your Cloudflare account.

## Production vs Preview Deployments

NuxtHub supports two types of deployments: production and preview.

### Production Deployments

- When setting up your project, you can specify a production branch (defaults to `main`)
- Successful deployments to the production branch will be:
  - Accessible via your primary domain
  - Also available at `<commit>.<project>.pages.dev`

### Preview Deployments

- Any deployment from a non-production branch (including pull requests) is considered a preview
- Successful preview deployments are accessible via:
  - `<commit>.<project>.pages.dev`
  - `<branch>.<project>.pages.dev`

::tip
Toggle between production and preview environments in the NuxtHub admin using the "Preview mode" switch.
::

## NuxtHub CLI

Deploy your local project with a single command:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub deploy
```

The command will:
1. Ensure you are logged in on [admin.hub.nuxt.com](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com)
2. Make sure you linked your Cloudflare account
3. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project or help you create a new one
4. Build your Nuxt project with the correct preset
5. Deploy it to your Cloudflare account with all the necessary resources (D1, KV, R2, etc.)
6. Provide you with a URL to access your project with a free `<my-app>.nuxt.dev` domain

::

::note
You can also install the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli) globally with: `npm i -g nuxthub`.
::

### Usage with CI/CD

::tip
If you are using GitHub for your project, jump to the [Github Action](#github-action) section.
::

::important
The `nuxthub deploy` command is designed to run **non-interactively** in CI/CD environments. It won’t prompt for additional input (such as logging in or linking the project). As long as the required environment variables are set, deployment will proceed automatically.
::

To integrate the `nuxthub deploy` command within your CI/CD pipeline, set the following environment variables:
- `NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_KEY` – Your project key available in:
  - Your project settings in the [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com)
  - Your `.env` file (if you ran `npx nuxthub link`)
- `NUXT_HUB_USER_TOKEN` – Your personal token, available in **User settings** → **Tokens** in the [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com)

**Example command:**
```bash [Terminal]
NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_KEY=<my-project-key> NUXT_HUB_USER_TOKEN=<my-user-token> npx nuxthub deploy
```

This will authenticate your user and link your NuxtHub project for deployment.

::note 
For security, **do not hardcode these values**. Instead, store them as environment variables in your CI/CD pipeline.
::

## GitHub Action

After linking a GitHub repository to your project, NuxtHub automatically adds a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy your application on every commit using the [NuxtHub GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-nuxthub).

NuxtHub integrates with [GitHub deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments). This allows you to:
- [View deployment statuses within GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/viewing-deployment-history)
- [Setup deployment concurrency](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/deploying-with-github-actions#using-concurrency)
- [Require approvals for deploying to environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/reviewing-deployments)

After deploying from a pull request, NuxtHub automatically adds a comment with information about the deployment.

:nuxt-img{src="/images/docs/nuxthub-github-app-pr-comment.png" alt="NuxtHUb GitHub Action commenting on pull requests" width="926" height="520"}

::tip
You can customise the workflow to tailor to any specific custom DevOps requirements.
::

::note{to="#linking-a-repository-to-existing-projects"}
Projects created prior to releasing our GitHub Action uses Pages CI for deployments. Read our [migration guide](#linking-a-repository-to-existing-projects).
::

### Default workflow

The GitHub Workflow added to your repository is automatically tailored to your project's package manager. This is an example of a workflow added for a project using pnpm.

We support pnpm, yarn, npm and Corepack. If you use a different package manager, you can customise the generated `nuxthub.yml` GitHub Action.

```yaml [.github/workflows/nuxthub.yml]
name: Deploy to NuxtHub
on: push

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: "Deploy to NuxtHub"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || 'preview' }}
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.deployment-url }}
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build application
        run: pnpm run build

      - name: Deploy to NuxtHub
        uses: nuxt-hub/action@v1
        id: deploy
```

### Options

#### Inputs

The following input parameters can be provided to the GitHub Action. Learn more about [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith) on GitHub's documentation.

::field-group
  ::field{name="directory" type="string" default="dist"}
    The directory of the built Nuxt application. Defaults to `dist`.
  ::

  ::field{name="project-key" type="string"}
    The project key of the NuxtHub project to deploy to. If the repository is linked to more than one project, project key is required.
  ::
::

#### Outputs

The GitHub Action provides the following outputs that you can use in subsequent workflow steps.


::field-group
  ::field{name="environment" type="'production' | 'preview'"}
    The environment of the deployment (e.g. production, preview).
  ::

  ::field{name="deployment-url" type="string"}
    The URL of the deployment. For preview environments, it links to the deployment of the commit.

    Examples:
    - https://example.nuxt.dev (main)
    - https://abcdefg.example.pages.dev (feat/example)
  ::

  ::field{name="branch-url" type="string"}
    The permanent URL for the current branch deployment.

    Examples:
    - https://example.nuxt.dev (main)
    - https://feat-example.example.pages.dev (feat/example)
  ::
::

### Environment Variables & Secrets

NuxtHub automatically copies all your project's environment variables to your GitHub repository actions environment variables.

When encrypting an environment variable in the NuxtHub Admin, a GitHub actions secret will be created in your repository.

You can view the environment variables and secrets synchronized by NuxtHub by navigating to **Repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions** on GitHub.

::warning
If you have a private repository on a free GitHub account or organization, NuxtHub won't be able to sync the env variables & secrets as GitHub repository environments (production / preview) are not available. In this case, you must manually set up the environment variables by navigating to **Repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions** on GitHub.
::

In order to use GitHub Actions variables and secrets, you need to update your workflow to expose them as environment variables:

```diff [.github/workflows/nuxthub.yml]
  - name: Build application
    run: pnpm run build
+   env:
+     NUXT_PUBLIC_VAR: ${{ vars.NUXT_PUBLIC_VAR }}
+     NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE }}
```

::note
This is mostly useful for build-time environment variables.
::

### Setup

#### Creating a new project

When creating a new project from a template, or importing a Git repository, the GitHub Action workflow will automatically be set up for you.

#### Linking a repository to existing projects

Link your project to a GitHub repository within [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) → Projects → `<Your Project>` → Settings → General → Git Repository

#### Migration from Cloudflare CI to GitHub Actions

Migrate your project to GitHub Actions within [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) → Projects → `<Your Project>` → Settings → General → Git Repository → Begin Migration.

::warning
Only non-secret environment variables are automatically copied to GitHub. Existing environment secrets are not automatically migrated to GitHub, and should be updated to sync them to GitHub.
::

#### Monorepo setup

Our GitHub integration supports deploying multiple applications from the same repository.

When linking a Git repository, set "project root directory" to the base folder of your Nuxt application corresponding to that NuxtHub project.

When a repository is already linked to at least one project, additional projects linked will have the generated GitHub Actions workflow named `nuxthub-<projectSlug>.yml`.

::note
When multiple projects are linked to the same repository, the [`project-key`](#inputs) input parameter must be specified on each [Deploy to NuxtHub GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-nuxthub).
::

**Current limitations**

- Separate applications should be deployed using different workflow jobs.

## Cloudflare Pages CI

Importing an existing Cloudflare Pages project that is already linked to a Git repository will use [Cloudflare Pages CI](https://pages.cloudflare.com) to deploy your project.

- Each commit will trigger a new deployment within Pages CI.
- Environment variables set within NuxtHub Admin will be available during CI.

::note
All existing projects with a Git repository linked to Cloudflare Pages prior to our GitHub Action being released uses [Cloudflare Pages CI](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for automated deployments.
::

::tip{to="#migrating-to-from-pages-ci"}
You can migrate from Cloudflare Pages CI to [GitHub Actions](#github-action) at any time. Read our [migration guide](#linking-a-repository-to-existing-projects).
::

## Self-hosted

You can deploy your project on your own Cloudflare account without using the NuxtHub Admin.

For that, you need to create the necessary resources in your Cloudflare account and configure your project to use them ([D1](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/d1), [KV](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces), [R2](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/new), etc.).

::note
You only need to create these resources if you have explicitly enabled them in the Hub Config.
::

Then, create a [Cloudflare Pages project](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages/new/provider/github) and link your GitHub or Gitlab repository and choose the Nuxt Framework preset in the build settings.

Once your project is created, open the `Settings` tab and set:
- Runtime > Compatibility flags
  - Add the `nodejs_compat` flag
- Bindings
  - KV namespace: `KV` and select your KV namespace created
  - KV namespace: `CACHE` and select your KV namespace for caching created
  - R2 bucket: `BLOB` and select your R2 bucket created
  - D1 database: `DB` and select your D1 database created
  - AI: `AI`
  - Browser: `BROWSER`
  - Vectorize: `VECTORIZE_<index name in upper case>` and select your Vectorize index created :br
    ```bash
    # Create the Vectorize index manually using
    npx wrangler vectorize create <index-name> --dimensions=<dimensions> --metric=<metric>
    ```

Go back to the `Deployment` tab and retry the last deployment by clicking on `...` then `Retry deployment`.

::tip
Once the deployment is done, you should be able to use `npx nuxt dev --remote` after [configuring the remote storage](/docs/getting-started/remote-storage#self-hosted)
