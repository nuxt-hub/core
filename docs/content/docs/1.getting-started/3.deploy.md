description: How to deploy your project with NuxtHub on your Cloudflare account.
---

::note
To deploy your Nuxt application on the Edge, we use Cloudflare Pages. Therefore, we require you to create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account. **You can deploy NuxtHub projects with a free Cloudflare account.**
::

## NuxtHub Console (alpha)

The [NuxtHub Console](https://console.hub.nuxt.com) is made to simplify your experience with NuxtHub, enabling you to effortlessly manage teams and projects, as well as deploy in seconds combined with the NuxtHub CLI.

After linking your Cloudflare account in the console, deploy your project with a single command:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub deploy
```

The command will:
1. Ensure your are logged in on console.hub.nuxt.com
2. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project (or create a new one)
3. Build your Nuxt project with the correct preset
4. Deploy it to your Cloudflare account with all the necessary resources
4. Provide you with a URL to access your project

Install the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli) globally with: `npm i -g nuxthub`.

### Remote Storage

Once your project is deployed, you can use the remote storage in your local project.

Start your Nuxt project with:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxt dev --remote
```

Your development project will now use the remote storage from your deployed project.

To always use the remote storage in your local project, update your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  hub: {
    // Always use remote storage in development
    remote: true
  }
})
```

::note
Nuxt will use the remote storage from your deployed project **as long as you are logged in with the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli) and the local project is linked to a NuxtHub project**.
::

## Self-hosted

You can deploy your project on your own Cloudflare account without using the NuxtHub Console.

For that, you need to create the necessary resources in your Cloudflare account and configure your project to use them.

1. Create a D1 database, KV namespace and R2 bucket in your Cloudflare account.
2. Create a Cloudflare Pages project and link it to your GitHub or Gitlab repository and choose the Nuxt Framework preset in the build settings

Once your project is created, open the `Settings -> Functions` tab and set:
- Placement: Smart
- KV namespace bingins
  - `KV` -> select your KV namespace created
- R2 bucket bindings
  - `BLOB` -> select your R2 bucket created
- D1 database bindings
  - `DB` -> select your D1 database created

Go back to the `Deployment` tab and retry the last deployment by clicing on `...` then `Retry deployment`.

Once the deployment is done, NuxtHub should be ready to use in your deployed project.

### Remote Storage

To enable remote storage in your self-hosted project, you need to create a secret key.

1. Set the `NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_SECRET` environment variable in your Cloudflare Pages project settings and retry the last deployment to apply the changes (you can generate a random secret on https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
2. Set the same `NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_SECRET` and `NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_URL` environment variables in your local project

```bash [.env]
NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_SECRET=my-project-secret-used-in-cloudflare-env
NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_URL=https://my-nuxthub-project.pages.dev
```

Then, start your Nuxt project with:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxt dev --remote
```

::warning
NuxtHub will use the remote data from your deployed project as long as the `NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_SECRET` matches the one in 
your Cloudflare Pages project settings.
