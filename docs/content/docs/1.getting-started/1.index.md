description: NuxtHub helps you build full-stack applications on the Edge.
---

NuxtHub aims to provide a complete backend experience for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) apps, allowing developers to build full-stack applications on the Edge.

::callout
It is **currently made to be deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)** as it leverages many Cloudflare features such as KV, D1, and R2. We are looking to support other platforms in the future.

## Storage

NuxtHub provides different storage to help you build full-stack applications:
- **SQL database** to store your application's data with [`hubDatabase()`](/docs/storage/database)
- **Key-Value** to store JSON data accessible globally with low-latency with [`hubKV()`](/docs/storage/kv)
- **Blob storage** to store static assets, such as images, video and more with [`hubBlob()`](/docs/storage/blob)

Each storage utils is auto-imported and ready to be used in your [Nuxt's server directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server).

::callout{icon="i-ph-plugs-connected-duotone" to="/docs/getting-started/deploy#remote-storage"}
NuxtHub comes with a powerful proxy system to connect to your project's resources from your local environment, allowing you to work with your remote storage as if it was local.

## Packages

We plan to provide a complete backend experience for Nuxt apps through various `@nuxthub` modules.

- [`@nuxthub/core`](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core): Main package to provide storage features
- `@nuxthub/auth`: Add authentication for user management (soon)
- `@nuxthub/email`: Send transactional emails to your users (soon)
- `@nuxthub/analytics`: Understand your traffic and track events within your application and API (soon)
- `@nuxthub/...`: You name it!

::callout
We are currently in the early stages of development and are looking for feedback from the community. If you are interested in contributing, please join us on [nuxt-hub/core](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core).

## Console (alpha)

[![nuxt-hub-console](/nuxthub-console.png){class="border rounded dark:border-gray-700 border-gray-200"}](https://console.hub.nuxt.com)

The [NuxtHub console](https://console.hub.nuxt.com) is a web based dashboard to manage your NuxtHub apps. It helps you deploy your NuxtHub apps with a single command on your Cloudflare account while provisioning all the necessary resources for you. It abstracts the complexity of managing full-stack Nuxt applications on Cloudflare.

### Features

- Link your Cloudflare account and stay in control, we never mark-up Cloudflare prices.
- Deploy your application with `nuxthub deploy` command
- Relax while it provision all the necessary resources (database, kv, blob)
- Manage your app's resources with an admin panel
- Visualize application, database, and cache metrics
- Give access to team members to manage the application without sharing your Cloudflare account
- Monitor your application with logs and analytics

::callout
The NuxtHub Console is currently in private alpha and is not yet open to the public. We are looking for early adopters to help us shape the platform. If you are interested, please register on [console.hub.nuxt.com](https://console.hub.nuxt.com) and tell us what you plan to build with NuxtHub.
