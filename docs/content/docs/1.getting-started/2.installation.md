## Start with our template

The easiest way to get started with NuxtHub is to use our template. It includes all the necessary configuration and resources to get you started with NuxtHub.

You can click on `Use this template` on https://github.com/nuxt-hub/starter or use the following command to create a new project:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi@latest init -t hub my-nuxthub-app
```

## Add NuxtHub to a project

1. Install the NuxtHub package to your project:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxthub/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxthub/core
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxthub/core
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @nuxthub/core
```

::

2. Install `wrangler` development dependency to your project:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D wrangler
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev wrangler
```

```bash [npm]
npm install --save-dev wrangler
```

```bash [bun]
bun add --dev wrangler
```

::

3. Add `@nuxthub/core` to your `extends` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxthub/core']
})
```

That's it! You can now use NuxtHub features in your Nuxt project.

::note
NuxtHub will create a `.data/hub` directory in your project root, which contains the necessary configuration files and resources for the features to work. It will also add it to the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.
::

## Options

Configure options in your `nuxt.config.ts` as such:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxthub/core'],
  hub: {
    remote: true
  }
})
```

::field-group
  ::field{name="remote" type="boolean"}
    Default to `false` - Allows working with remote storage (database, kv, blob) from your deployed project. :br
    You can set `NUXT_HUB_REMOTE=true` in your `.env` file to enable the remote option.:br
    Or use the `--remote` flag when running your Nuxt project locally (e.g. `nuxt dev --remote`).
