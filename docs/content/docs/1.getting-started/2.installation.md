## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with NuxtHub is to use our template. It includes all the necessary configuration and resources to get you started with NuxtHub.

Click on `Use this template` on [github.com/nuxt-hub/starter](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/starter) to create a new repository based on the template.

You can also run this command to create a new project locally:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub init my-app
```

Then, inside your project directory (`my-app` in the example above), run your development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

Your project will be available on http://localhost:3000

## Add to a Nuxt project

1. Install the NuxtHub module to your project:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi@latest module add hub
```

This command will install `@nuxthub/core` as dependency and add it to your `modules` section of your `nuxt.config`.

2. Install `wrangler` development dependency to your project:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D wrangler
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev wrangler
```

```bash [npm]
npm install --save-dev wrangler
```

```bash [bun]
bun add --dev wrangler
```

::

That's it! You can now use NuxtHub features in your Nuxt project.

::note
NuxtHub will create a `.data/hub` directory in your project root, which contains the necessary configuration files and resources for the features to work. It will also add it to the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.
::

## Options

Configure options in your `nuxt.config.ts` as such:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxthub/core'],
  hub: {
    // NuxtHub options
  }
})
```
