We are excited to announce that we have added a new feature to NuxtHub Blobs: **Folders**!

::tip
This feature is available on all [NuxtHub plans](/pricing).
::

It comes with the [v0.6.0](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core/releases/tag/v0.6.0) release of `@nuxthub/core`.

When uploading a blob, you can now specify a folder path with the `prefix`. This will allow you to organize your blobs in a more structured way.

```ts
const { put } = hubBlob()

await put('my-blob.txt', myFile, {
  prefix: 'folder/subfolder'
})
```

When viewing your blobs in the [NuxtHub admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com), you will now see a folder structure:
