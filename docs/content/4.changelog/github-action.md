We're thrilled to release our brand new [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nuxt-hub) for deploying to NuxtHub. Our new GitHub integration sets up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy your application on every commit.

And many more:
- **Deployment Protection**: Support for GitHub's deployment protection rules, enabling approval workflows and environment restrictions. [Learn more on GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules).
- **Secure**: Our GitHub integration prevents the need for long-lived secrets as it uses OIDC under the hood
- **Customizable**: You can create tailored workflows to fit your DevOps requirements using our GitHub Action

## Migrating to GitHub Actions

Migrating from Pages CI or our legacy existing GitHub Actions using NuxtHub CLI recipe is simple, and can be done from [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Git.

When migrating from Cloudflare Pages CI, please note:

- Deployment quotas will shift from [Pages CI limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/#builds) to your [GitHub Actions usage](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes)
- Environment variables and secrets needed at build time should be managed through [GitHub Environment settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-environment)
