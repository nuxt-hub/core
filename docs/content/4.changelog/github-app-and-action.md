We're thrilled to release our brand new [GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/nuxthub-admin) & [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-nuxthub) to help you create and deploy Nuxt applications to NuxtHub.


## Pull Request Integration

Once setup, NuxtHub will automatically comment on pull requests with branch URLs, permalinks and QR codes for easy preview access.

## GitHub Deployments

NuxtHub also integrates with GitHub's deployment system, including status updates and environment tracking.

This includes GitHub Deployments support in pull requests.

And many more:
- **Deployment Protection**: Support for GitHub's deployment protection rules which enable approval workflows and environment restrictions ([learn more on GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules))
- **Secure**: Our GitHub integration prevents the need for long-lived secrets as it uses OIDC under the hood
- **Customizable**: You can create tailored workflows to fit your DevOps requirements using our GitHub Action

## Cloning a Template

Thanks to the new GitHub App, you can now clone a template from NuxtHub Admin and deploy it with a single click.

## Migrating to GitHub Actions

Migrating from Cloudflare Pages CI or the legacy GitHub Action is simple and can be done from [NuxtHub Admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Git.

<!-- img of migration alert -->

When migrating from Cloudflare Pages CI, please note:

- Deployment quotas will shift from [Pages CI limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/#builds) to your [GitHub Actions usage](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes)
- Environment variables and secrets needed at build time should be managed through [GitHub Environment settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-environment) (we are working on a way to synchronize them automatically)
