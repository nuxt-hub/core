We are excited to announce that we have added a new page to NuxtHub: **Deployment Details**!

:nuxt-img{src="/images/changelog/deployment-details.png" alt="NuxtHub Deployment Details" width="915" height="515"}

You can now access more information about each deployment such as:
- **Details:** Status, Branch, Commit and more
- **Build Logs:** Access your deployment build logs
- **Server Logs:** Access your deployment server logs in real-time

Based on the deployment status, you can also manage your deployment by:
- Retrying the deployment
- Cancelling the pending deployment
- Rolling back to a previous deployment
