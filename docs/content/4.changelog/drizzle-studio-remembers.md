::note
We partnered with the Drizzle team to leverage [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) for the admin UI of your databases within NuxtHub. :br Allowing you to explore your production & preview SQL database connected to your project.
::

We improved the experience so Drizzle Studio remembers you current state when you navigate away and come back. When opening the database tab, you will be taken back to the same table you were last time with the same filters applied.
