We are excited to announce that we have added a new page to your NuxtHub project: **Server Cache**!

:nuxt-img{src="/images/changelog/server-cache.png" alt="NuxtHub Deployment Details" width="915" height="515"}

It works with:
- [`cachedEventHandler`](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache#cached-event-handlers)
- [`cachedFunction`](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache#cached-functions)
- [`routeRules`](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache#caching-route-rules)
