description: NuxtHub helps you build full-stack applications on the Edge.
---

NuxtHub aims to provide a complete backend experience for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) apps, allowing developers to build full-stack applications on the Edge.

::callout
It is **currently made to be deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)** as it leverages many Cloudflare features such as KV, D1, and R2. We are looking to support other platforms in the future.
::

## Features

NuxtHub provides a set of features to help you build full-stack applications:
- **SQL database** to store your application's data
- **Blob storage** to store static assets, such as images, video and more
- **Key-Value** to store JSON data accessible globally with low-latency

Each feature comes with its auto-imported server composable to use in your [Nuxt's server directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server).

NuxtHub comes with a powerful proxy system to connect to your project's resources from your local environment, allowing you to work with your remote data as if it was local.

## Modules

We plan to provide a complete backend experience for Nuxt apps through various `@nuxthub` modules.

- [`@nuxthub/core`](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core): Main module to provide storage features
- `@nuxthub/auth`: Authentication module for user management
- `@nuxthub/analytics`: Analytics module to track events within your applicaiton and API
- `@nuxthub/...`: You name it!

We are currently in the early stages of development and are looking for feedback from the community. If you are interested in contributing, please join us on [nuxt-hub/core](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core).

## Console (alpha)

The [NuxtHub console](https://hub.nuxt.com) is a web based dashboard to manage your NuxtHub apps. It helps you deploy your NuxtHub apps with a single command on your Cloudflare account while provisioning all the necessary resources for you. It abstracts the complexity of managing full-stack Nuxt applications on Cloudflare.

### Features

- Link your Cloudflare account and stay in control, we never mark-up Cloudflare prices.
- Deploy your application with `nuxthub deploy` command
- Relax while it provision all the necessary resources (database, kv, blob)
- Manage your app's resources with an admin panel
- Visualize application, database, and cache metrics
- Give access to team members to manage the application without sharing your Cloudflare account
- Monitor your application with logs and analytics

::callout
The NuxtHub console is currently in private alpha and is not yet open to the public. We are looking for early adopters to help us shape the platform. If you are interested, please register on [hub.nuxt.com](https://hub.nuxt.com) and tell us what you plan to build with NuxtHub.
