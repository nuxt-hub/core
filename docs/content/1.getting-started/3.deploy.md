description: How to deploy your project with NuxtHub.
---

To deploy your Nuxt application on the Edge, we use Cloudflare Pages. Therefore, we require you to create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/){target=_blank} account.

Then two options are offered to you:

## Using hub.nuxt.com

The [NuxtHub admin](https://hub.nuxt.com){target=_blank} is designed to simplify your experience with the NuxtHub module, enabling you to effortlessly manage teams and projects, as well as deploy in seconds combined with the NuxtHub CLI.

### Setup your team

First, you need to connect to [NuxtHub admin](https://hub.nuxt.com){target=_blank}. A default team is automatically created for you and you will be able to update it in the settings.

Next, you are invited to setup your team with Cloudflare, meaning you need to link it to your Cloudflare account. Follow the instructions by creating an access token on Cloudflare, then linking it to the team in the admin.

Done? Now your team is connected to Cloudflare.

### Setup your project

From here, you can either create your project in the admin or with the CLI.

#### Admin

<!-- TODO -->

#### CLI

Then, install NuxtHub CLI with any binaries manager (we recommand Volta.sh):

```bash
volta install nuxthub
```

Then open a terminal in at the root of your project and run:

```bash
nuxthub deploy
```

This command will:

1. Ask you to connect to hub.nuxt.com, if not already logged in
2. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project, if not already linked
  - Select a team
  - Select or create a project
3. ?

<!-- TODO -->

## On your own

Even if you don't want to use NuxtHub admin, you can use the NuxtHub module.
